Feeling honored to be a co-author of another award-worthy paper: [Establishing a new computational method to predict effects of gaming: A feasibility study on growth mindset](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78269-5_8){:target="_blank"}.

In the paper we show the potential of a new method using AI and natural language processing on player reviews to approximate video game effects. Huge thanks to Manuel Ninaus, who presented the paper at the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) 2024 conference in Berlin and received the [Best Paper Award](https://conf.seriousgamessociety.org/gala-2024-awards/){:target="_blank"} there, Moritz Edlinger, and Nathalie Scheucher, who laid the foundation of the paper with her master thesis at the Department of Psychology at the University of Graz.
