I am not Einstein, but I can definitely also say that Prague is worth a visit. The 33rd International Congress of Psychology was in no way inferior to the beauty of Prague. Not only did the congress bring together thousands of researchers from all over the world, but it also gave me the opportunity to present our [research on game-based learning](http://stefaneha.github.io/files/2024-07-23_ICP.pdf){:target="_blank"} to a broad and diverse community.

It was also a pleasure to meet my long-time research colleague Markus Martini (the formal copyright holder of these images) again and talk science while exploring this beautiful city and some of its restaurant.
