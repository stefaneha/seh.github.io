Happy to continue my collaboration with the [AT Gesäuse National Park](https://nationalpark-gesaeuse.at/en/){:target="_blank"} in 2025 in the scope of the project [“Nationalpark Partnerschulen - Die Schule der Wildnis”](https://nationalpark-gesaeuse.at/nationalpark-erleben/schulen-und-gruppen/fuer-schulen/fuer-schulen-eintagige-programme/){:target="_blank"}.

In this project, we evaluate a program of the national park “Gesäuse”, located in Upper Styria, Austria, aiming for informing and educating students from local schools about endangered inhabitants of the wilderness in the national park and, at the same time, raising awareness about how important it is to protect these species together with their special habitats.
