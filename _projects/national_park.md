<u>Abstract</u>: National parks have many important societal tasks to fulfill. Among other things, they should inform the general public about the importance of preserving and protecting nature and wilderness and maintain a high level of nature awareness in society. One way of fulfilling this task is to hold regular events for local schools in order to reach children (and - to some extent - their parents) from the local population in the scope of biological and environmental education. However, how and to what extent are such programs actually affecting the awareness about nature and the environment in the participating children and, more generally, in the local population? Or, in other words: To what extent can national parks fulfill their supposed societal role through educational programs like these? Hence, to evaluate such a program of the AT Gesäuse National Park, we use a mixed-methods approach in this project, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. To do so, we develop specific questionnaires and structured interviews allowing to evaluate the national park for the intended purpose. Personally, I assist mainly in the development of questionnaires and quantitative data analysis in the scope of the project.
