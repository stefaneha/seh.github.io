My name is Stefan and I am a University Assistant at the Department of Psychology at the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/){:target="_blank"}, affiliated with the [Digital Psychology Lab](https://digilab.uni-graz.at/en/){:target="_blank"}. There, I am currently doing my doctorate in psychology in the scope of the project [Game elements: Understanding their influence for learning (GUI:L)](https://stefaneha.github.io/projects/game_elements/){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I did a doctorate in (molecular) physics at the University of Innsbruck, where I also worked as a physicist and lecturer, and carried out my first psychophysiological experiments during my psychology studies, thereby following a long-standing research interest.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:10px;">For as long as I can remember, this interest has revolved around the phenomenon of episteme, which is the ancient Greek word for knowledge or understanding. How is it possible to know or understand anything or come to an understanding (that is, how is it possible to learn)? How is it possible to read a manual and then know how to operate a machine for a specific purpose? How is it possible to read a map and then walk and reach a particular destination? The mere possibility of such a thing presupposes a certain regularity or stability of the world in which this phenomenon occurs. Would the path change unpredictably while we were studying the map, we could never find our destination. This presupposed external structure is what I would call the exogenuous aspect of episteme and, probably, the reason why I spent about a decade on studying the material constitution of the world. Yet the possibility of understanding presupposes more than that. It presupposes that those who *do* the understanding are capable of changing, adapting, learning. Their behavioral capabilities must be flexible enough to adapt, but, at the same time, allow for the emergence of stable patterns that stand the test of time (that is, they must be capable of learning and show memory). This is what I would call the endogenuous aspect of episteme and, probably, the reason why I have spent about another decade studying the constitution of the human mind. And lastly, the two of those aspects must come together (the reason for Nietzsche's assertion that it always requires two to understand), resulting in the emergence of an understanding from the dynamic interaction between those capable of understanding and a world allowing for it. This is what I would call the dialogical aspect of episteme and to which I hope to be able to dedicate about another decade of focussed study and exploration by delving deeper into the science of complexity and the theory of probability (or induction). And after that, I hope, that enough years will remain to bring all three aspects together in a coherent theory of episteme.</p>

Besides pursuing this research interest, I like to enjoy good books (like Milan Kundera's *The Book of laughter and Forgetting*), movies (like *The Dark Knight* trilogy), video games (like *Baldur's Gate 1 & 2*), music (like the Smashing Pumpkins' *Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness*), or a good conversation during a long and aimless walk through the woods (this is how I would imagine heaven).
