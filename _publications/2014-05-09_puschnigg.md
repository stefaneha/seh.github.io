In the present study we performed dissociative electron attachment (DEA) measurements with the tripeptide trialanine, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>17</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, utilizing a crossed electron-molecular beam experiment with high electron energy resolution (~100 meV). Anion efficiency yields as a function of the incident electron energy are obtained for the most abundant anions up to electron energies of ~4 eV. Quantum chemical calculations are performed to determine the thermochemical thresholds for the anions observed in the measurements. There is no evidence of a molecular anion with lifetime of mass spectrometric timescales. The dehydrogenated closed shell anion (M-H)<sup>−</sup> is one of the fragment anions observed for which the calculations show that H-loss is energetically possible from carboxyl, as well as amide groups. In contrast to the dipeptide dialanine and monomer alanine the cleavage of the N-C<sub>α</sub> bond in the peptide chain is already possible by attachment of electrons at ~0 eV.
