Gas phase dissociative electron attachment (DEA) measurements with methyl-dialanine, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, are performed in a crossed electron-molecular beam experiment at high energy resolution (∼120 meV). Anion efficiency yields as a function of the incident electron energy are obtained for the most abundant fragments up to electron energies of ∼15 eV. There is no evidence of molecular anion formation whereas the dehydrogenated closed shell anion (M–H)<sup>−</sup> is one of the most dominant reaction products. Quantum chemical calculations are performed to investigate the electron attachment process and to elucidate site selective bond cleavage in the (M–H)<sup>−</sup> DEA-channel. Previous DEA studies on dialanine have shown that (M–H)<sup>−</sup> formation proceeds through abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the carboxyl and amide groups, contributing to two distinct resonances at 0.81 and 1.17 eV, respectively [D. Gschliesser, V. Vizcaino, M. Probst, P. Scheier and S. Denifl, Chem.–Eur. J., 2012, 18, 4613–4619]. Here we show that by methylation of the carboxyl group, all (calculated) thresholds for H-loss from the different sites in the dialanine molecule are shifted up to a maximum of 1.4 eV. The lowest lying resonance observed experimentally for (M–H)<sup>−</sup> remains operative from the amide group at the electron energy of 2.4 eV due to the methylation. We further study methylation-induced effects on the unimolecular dissociation leading to a variety of negatively charged DEA products.
