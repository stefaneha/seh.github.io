Dissociative electron attachment to PtBr<sub>2</sub> in the gas phase was studied in the low electron energy range from zero up to 10 eV with an energy resolution of 150 meV. The experiments were carried out using a hemispherical electron monochromator coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and pulse counting acquisition system. The only anion observed was Br<sup>−</sup>. This ion is formed at three resonance electron energies: 0.4 eV, 1.2 eV and 7 eV. By the measurements of the Br<sup>−</sup> formation at different sample temperatures (in the 350–430 K range) the 0.4 eV resonance was associated with the electron capture by HBr generated in the apparatus at elevated temperatures. In addition, the thermodynamic thresholds for dissociative electron attachment reactions for platinum(II) bromide were calculated and compared with the experimental results.
