Enthalpies and free energies of reaction for small neutral and charged beryllium deuterides BeD, BeD_2, and BeD_3 that have been calculated are reported for a temperature range of 0 K to 1000 K. We discuss probable dissociation channels and possible ways of producing BeD by localizing the relevant transition states and by calculating corresponding rate constants. BeD and BeD+ are found to be the most stable ones among the considered compounds. BeD_2 and BeD_2^+ are more likely to decompose into Be^0,+ + D_2 than into BeD^0,+ + D. The metastable BeD_3 and BeD_3^+ predominantly decompose into BeD^0,+ + D_2. In light of our results on the reaction energetics, we can interpret the pathways for production of BeD via BeD_2 and BeD_3 intermediates observed in molecular dynamics simulations.
