Negative ion formation through dissociative electron attachment to the gas-phase volatile anaestheticsenflurane and isoflurane (C3H2ClF5O) and to two chlorinated ethanes, pentachloroethane (C2HCl5) andhexachloroethane (C2Cl6), have been studied in a crossed electron-molecular beam two sector field massspectrometer experiment. Anion efficiency curves for the negatively charged fragments have been mea-sured over an electron energy range of approximately 0–17 eV, with an energy resolution of ∼1 eV. Forthe chlorinated ethanes, resonance features were generally found at ∼0 eV and at 7.5 eV. For the volatileanaesthetics, no zero energy resonances were observed. Instead, product anions were detected mainlyin the 2–3 eV and 9 eV energy regions, with the exception of Cl−, whose dominant resonance occurs atapproximately 0.6 eV and 0.9 eV for isoflurane and enflurane, respectively. To aid in the interpretation ofthe experimental results, quantum chemical calculations providing thermochemical thresholds of anionformation are also presented.
