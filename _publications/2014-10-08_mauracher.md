The formation of dianions in helium nanodroplets is reported for the first time. The fullerene cluster dianions (C<sub>60</sub>)<sub>n</sub><sup>2−</sup> and (C<sub>70</sub>)<sub>n</sub><sup>2−</sup> were observed by mass spectrometry for n ≥ 5 when helium droplets containing the appropriate fullerene were subjected to electron impact at approximately 22 eV. A new mechanism for dianion formation is described, which involves a two-electron transfer from the metastable He<sup>−</sup> ion. As well as the prospect of studying other dianions at low temperature using helium nanodroplets, this work opens up the possibility of a wider investigation of the chemistry of He<sup>−</sup>, a new electron-donating reagent.
