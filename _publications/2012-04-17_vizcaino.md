The mechanism of a hydrogen loss reaction upon dissociative electron attachment to organic acids and amino acids has been a matter of controversy. In this study, we investigate this process for three isomers of aminobutanoic acid and the deuterated analogue of the α isomer (αA<sub>D</sub>) in the electron energy range 0–2.5 eV. We implement the resonant R-matrix theory, applying a one-dimensional model involving electron capture into the σ*(OH) orbital which reproduces convincingly the conspicuous features of the experimental cross sections, i.e. the pronounced cusps at the vibrational excitation threshold, the substantially different shapes of the three constitutional isomers and the characteristic differences between αA and its isotopologue αA<sub>D</sub>.
