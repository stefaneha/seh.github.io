Cyanamide (NH<sub>2</sub>CN) is a molecule relevant for interstellar chemistry and the chemical evolution of life. In the present investigation, dissociative electron attachment to NH<sub>2</sub>CN has been studied in a crossed electron–molecular beams experiment in the electron energy range from about 0 eV to 14 eV. The following anionic species were detected: NHCN<sup>−</sup>, NCN<sup>−</sup>, CN<sup>−</sup>, NH<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, NH<sup>−</sup>, and CH<sub>2</sub>−. The anion formation proceeds within two broad electron energy regions, one between about 0.5 and 4.5 eV and a second between 4.5 and 12 eV. A discussion of possible reaction channels for all measured negative ions is provided. The experimental results are compared with calculations of the thermochemical thresholds of the anions observed. For the dehydrogenated parent anion, we explain the deviation between the experimental appearance energy of the anion with the calculated corresponding reaction threshold by electron attachment to the isomeric form of NH<sub>2</sub>CN—carbodiimide.
