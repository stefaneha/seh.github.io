Earlier studies repeatedly showed increased learner motivation due to game elements, while overall cognitive effects on learning outcomes were absent. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is provided by theories integrating cognitive and affective learning processes: the beneficial effect on learner motivation eventually balancing simultaneously higher cognitive processing demands associated with game elements. In this paper, we provide results of an empirical test of this theoretical suggestion. In particular, we report results of a value-added online experiment (with n = 61 participants, mostly students; 44 female, 15 male, 2 diverse; median age: 24 years), comparing a more gameful with a less gameful version of a learning task. In agreement with earlier studies, we find similar cognitive learning outcomes (δ < 0.2), but medium (δ ~ 0.5) and large (δ ~ 0.9) effects on affective and motivational outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, mediation models show that a small negative direct effect of game elements on cognitive outcomes (β ~ −0.2) is indeed effectively cancelled by an indirect path through motivational outcomes (β ~ +0.4). Overall, our results corroborate the tenability of the integrated cognitive affective model of learning with multimedia. This implies its feasibility in purposefully designing learning environments with specific motivational or cognitive aims in mind.
