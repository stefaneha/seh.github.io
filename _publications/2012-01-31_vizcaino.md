A detailed study on dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB) in the gas phase is presented. Ion yields as a function of the incident electron energy from about 0 to 14 eV have been measured for the most dominant fragments including anions such as NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, [M-NO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>−</sup> or N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. To help identifying which anion and neutral fragments are formed upon electron attachment we calculated the thermodynamic thresholds using the G4(MP2) method.
