The effects of interactions between He<sup>−</sup> and clusters of fullerenes in helium nanodroplets are described. Electron transfer from He− to (C<sub>60</sub>)<sub>n</sub> and (C<sub>70</sub>)<sub>n</sub> clusters results in the formation of the corresponding fullerene cluster dianions. This unusual double electron transfer appears to be concerted and is most likely guided by electron correlation between the two very weakly bound outer electrons in He<sup>−</sup>. We suggest a mechanism which involves long range electron transfer followed by the conversion of He<sup>+</sup> into He<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, where formation of the He–He bond in He<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> releases sufficient kinetic energy for the cation and the dianion to escape their Coulombic attraction. By analogy with the corresponding dications, the observation of a threshold size of n ≥ 5 for formation of both (C<sub>60</sub>)<sub>n</sub><sup>2−</sup> and (C<sub>70</sub>)<sub>n</sub><sup>2−</sup> is attributed to Coulomb explosion rather than an energetic constraint. We also find that smaller dianions can be observed if water is added as a co-dopant. Other aspects of He<sup>−</sup> chemistry that are explored include its role in the formation of multiply charged fullerene cluster cations and the sensitivity of cluster dianion formation on the incident electron energy.
