We performed density functional theory calculations to explore the energetic and geometric aspects of the permeation of H<sub>2</sub>, BeH<sub>x</sub>, OH<sub>x</sub> (x = 1, 2) and CH<sub>y</sub> (y = 1â€“4) through the central hexagon of coronene. Coronene serves as a cluster model for extended graphene which can be regarded as the first layer of a graphite (0001) surface. We compare the energy barriers encountered by these molecular projectiles with the ones that are obtained for atomic H, Be, C and O. The barriers are substantially lower if projectiles possess free valences that can bind to the carbon entity. Furthermore, for some of the species fragmentation is observed. Implications with respect to plasma-surface interaction are discussed.
